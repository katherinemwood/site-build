This is a [Shiny application](https://katherinemwood.shinyapps.io/lakens_effect_sizes/) that brings the beloved [effect size calculator spreadsheets](https://osf.io/ixGcd/) by [Daniel Lakens](https://twitter.com/lakens) online. The application will produce as many common effect sizes as possible given the information available.
