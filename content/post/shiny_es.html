<p>It had been a long time since I had built anything, and I needed to scratch the itch. I decided to build a Shiny port of <a href="https://osf.io/ixGcd/">Daniël Lakens’s beloved effect size calculator spreadsheets</a>. You can find the app itself <a href="https://katherinemwood.shinyapps.io/lakens_effect_sizes/">here</a>.</p>
<p>These sheets are handy for a number of reasons, primarily if a paper or talk reports stats but no effect sizes (or if you want to double-check reported stats or effect sizes). I thought it would be convenient to have an online version.</p>
<p>All of the math is based on what’s used in the spreadsheet, and the default examples are taken from there too.</p>
<p>This was a really fun build, mostly because the actual math was pretty straightforward (and I could easily check it against the spreadsheets to make sure it was working, which is a refreshing change). I got to spend more time digging into the web-dev side of things, dealing with layout and the reactivity of the components of the app. I learned a lot, and it was great to be working with Shiny again. Big thanks to Daniël Lakens for giving me the go-ahead to do this!</p>
<p>The code is <a href="https://github.com/katherinemwood/lakens_effect_sizes">on Github</a>. Suggestions for improvements and bug reporting encouraged!</p>
