I have a PhD in Psychology from the University of Illinois, where I specialized in experimental psychology and vision science. I studied when and why we're oblivious to something right in front of us if we happen to be concentrating on something else, how much information from our environments we actually use, and how magicians can fool us right before our eyes. I also worked in the replication and reproducibility space, helping others run replications, running one of my own, and building a data reconstruction tool with a colleague.

I loved the programming, experiment design, and data analysis aspects of my grad school career, so I transitioned to data science. I completed a fellowship with Insight Data Science to get experience applying my academic skillset in a product-focused, industry context and am looking for my next opportunity.

In my off hours I'm rock climbing, running, cooking, and gaming.
